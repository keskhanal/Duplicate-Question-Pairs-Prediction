# Duplicate Questions Predictions

Duplicate Questions Predictions is a flask based web app which can be used to check whether question pairs are duplicates or not. The data used for this app can be found on kaggle [Quora Question Pairs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs). 

Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. This is the techniques to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not. Doing so will make it easier to find high quality answers to questions resulting in an improved experience for Quora writers, seekers, and readers.
